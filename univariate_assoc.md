## Understanding the Table Columns 

- **Feature**: Variable from the dataset tested for association with the outcome.
- **p-value**: The raw statistical significance from the univariate test.
- **q-value**: The FDR-adjusted p-value using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to account for multiple testing.

## Strongly Significant Features (q-value < 0.05)

These variables show **statistically significant association** with the outcome even after multiple test correction:

- **`site_liver`**  
  - ðŸ”¥ Extremely significant  
  - Strongly associated with outcome; liver involvement may indicate worse prognosis.

- **`race`**  
  - Demographic factor significantly associated with the outcome.

- **`site_lung`**  
  - Lung metastasis or involvement is highly significant.

- **`primary_site`**  
  - Origin of the cancer is significantly linked to the outcome.

- **`site_brain`**  
  - Brain involvement shows meaningful outcome differences.

- **`pr_status`**, **`er_status`**, **`her2_status`**  
  - Hormone receptor statuses are key predictors of outcome, consistent with oncological literature.

- **`subtype`**  
  - Subtype of cancer is significantly associated with the outcome.

- **`marital_status`**  
  - Borderline significant; social factors may influence health outcomes.

## Non-Significant Features (q-value â‰ˆ 1)

These features did **not** show statistically significant association with the outcome:

- **`site_bone`**  
  - No strong association found.

- **`age`**  
  - No significant univariate relationship with the outcome.

- **`regional_nodes_examined`**, **`regional_nodes_positive`**  
  - No meaningful difference in outcome detected based on node involvement alone.

- **`year_of_diagnosis`**  
  - No time-based trend detected in outcome variation.

## Interpretation Notes

- **Low q-values** (e.g., < 0.05): Indicate reliable and statistically significant features after correcting for multiple comparisons.
- **High q-values** (e.g., â‰ˆ 1): Suggest no strong evidence of association.
- **Univariate limitations**: These results do not account for confounding or feature interactions.
